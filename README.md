## A Basic Date Request Site With An Old Internet Vibe 

Because using a website that gives that old internet vibe with cats and a poor pixalated background radiates the phrase 'I care about you'

### Features

1. Cat GIF's that change (They're very cute)
2. A No button that moves constantly when you hover over it (or click on mobiles)
3.  Fully responsive, which means the content adjusts to most screen sizes

### Additional Notes

If you want to send someone the same site with a few edits, but you're not much of a coder, open the *"Website with inline code"* folder and you'll see that there is a single webpage (HTML file) with all the necessary code. There are comments inside tags that look like this *'<!--Example text-->'* or *'//Example Text'* that can guide you edit this file.
